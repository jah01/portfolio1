                    <p class="pFirst">My name is Joey, I'm a sophomore at Ohio State, and I am in the CSE major.</p><p>I enjoy working with computer software and writing code, and I have been working in this environment since my first year of high school. I have taken all sorts of programming courses throughout the past five years, created minor side projects, and explored many different areas associated with coding. Outside of coding, I enjoy running, listening to music, and any activities that involve my friends.</p><p>Coding is something I love because creating something out of nothing has always interested me. There's nothing like starting a project with no experience and leading yourself through it. I love using my knowledge of coding to solve problems, but more importantly, make things look appealing. Despite my modest and minimal layout,  it took a great deal of time to make sure everything went where it was supposed to and everything behaves well regardless of resolution (hopefully!). Web design has been one of my favorite things to do when I'm bored or just looking for a challenge recently. I have been coding in HTML and CSS for a couple years now, with breaks in between. I am entirely self-taught when it comes to web design, so even a simple website like this makes me happy; I get to see what I have learned.</p><p>Currently, I am working on an app that tracks goals and habits with my friends over the summer. If you'd like to know more about who I am and what I do, feel free to click on any of the other categories above. Thanks for visiting!</p>
